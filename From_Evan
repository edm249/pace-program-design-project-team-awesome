Christina, excellent job on the initial main.cpp! 
I hadnt been able to connect to anyone in the group so I wrote the functions out and was going to upload my attempt,  
but yours is much cleaner (and I hadn't written the pre/post conditions yet)

Im still trying to figure out where we can talk to each other, but for now, I guess this works.

I left a fork on your initial From_Christina submission to say hi, but notifications are hard to follow here. 
You (and anyone else in our group) can reach me at edm249@email.vccs.edu for next week so you're not doing the group assignment solo again.

Evan
